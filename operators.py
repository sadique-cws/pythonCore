# operator are symbol that perform operations on variable and value. for example


print(5 + 6) 

# here, + is an operator that adds two numbers 5 and 6 

# type of Python Operator
# here is a list of different type of python operator 
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# 2. Assignment Operators
# 3. Comparison Operators
# 4. Logical Operators
# 5. Bitwise Operators 
# 6. Special Operators
# 
# 
# Arithmetic Operator: use for Mathematical Operations like addition, subtraction
# multiplication etc.
# 
# e.g 
# total = 10 - 5 
# here is a list of arithmetic operator 
# 1. + (addition)
# 2. - (subtraction)
# 3. * (multiplication)
# 4. / (division)
# 5. // (floor division)
# 6. % (modulo)
# 7. ** (Power)

# examples
a = 7 
b = 5 

print("addition: ", a + b) #12 
print("subtraction : ", a - b) #2
print("multiplication :", a * b) #35
print("division : ", a / b) #1.4
print("floor division :", a // b) #1
print("modulus : ", a % b) #2
print("Power : ", a ** b) # 16807

# Assignment Operator: use to assign values to variables. for examples
x = 5 
# here, = is an assignment operator that assigns 5 to x 
# 1. = (assignment operator)
# 2. += (addition assignment) (a += b || a = a + b)
# 3. -= (subtraction assignment)
# 4. /= (division assignment)
# 5. %= (remainder assignment)
# 6. **= (exponent Assignment)
# examples

a = 5 
a += 7 # a = a + b
print(a) #12
# 3. Comparison Operator: use to compare where a is greater than b or not.
# 1. == (is Equal to) e.g 3 == 5 return False
# 2. != (Not Equal to) e.g 3 != 5 return True
# 3. > (greater than) e.g 3 > 5 return False
# 4. < (less than) e.g 3 < 5 return True
# 5. >= (greater than equal to) e.g 3 >= 5 return False
# 6. <= (less than equal to) e.g 3 <= 5 return True 

# examples 
a, b = 3, 5 

print(a == b) #false
print(a != b) #true 
print(a > b) #false
print(a < b ) #true 
print(a >= b) #false 
print(a <= b) #true 

# 4. Logical Operator : use to check weather expression is True or Note as per Logic Gates
# 1. and : True only if both expression are True
# 2  or : True if at least one operand is True
# 3. not : True if the operand is false 

# e.g
print(True and True) #True
print(True or False) #True
print(not True) #false
print(True and False) #False
